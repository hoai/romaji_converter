## Romanji Conversion Chrome Extension

### supports the following language conversions from `Romanji`
- `Hiragana`
- `Katakana`

This tool makes no network requests and can be used totally offline! Just highlight some `Romanji` text, right click and select the dialect of writing you would like to see it turn into. The changes on the page are **non-permanent** and refreshing the page will cause the text to return back to its original form.
